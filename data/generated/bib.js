        "abstract": "There is an increasing need for processing and understanding relevant information generated by the systematic collection of public health data over time. However, the analysis of those time series usually requires advanced modeling techniques, which are not necessarily mastered by staff, technicians and researchers working on public health and epidemiology. Here a user-friendly tool, EPIPOI, is presented that facilitates the exploration and extraction of parameters describing trends, seasonality and anomalies that characterize epidemiological processes. It also enables the inspection of those parameters across geographic regions. Although the visual exploration and extraction of relevant parameters from time series data is crucial in epidemiological research, until now it had been largely restricted to specialists.",

        "abstract": "Information visualization as a field is growing rapidly in popularity since the first information visualization conference in 1995. However, as a consequence of its growth, it is increasingly difficult to follow the growing body of literature within the field. Survey papers and literature reviews are valuable tools for managing the great volume of previously published research papers, and the quantity of survey papers in visualization has reached a critical mass. To this end, this survey paper takes a quantum step forward by surveying and classifying literature survey papers in order to help researchers understand the current landscape of Information Visualization. It is, to our knowledge, the first survey of survey papers (SoS) in Information Visualization. This paper classifies survey papers into natural topic clusters which enables readers to find relevant literature and develops the first classification of classifications. The paper also enables researchers to identify both mature and less developed research directions as well as identify future directions. It is a valuable resource for both newcomers and experienced researchers in and outside the field of Information Visualization and Visual Analytics.",

Besides the Electronic Health Records (EHRs), the event logs from Hospital Information Systems (HIS) are a very efficient source of information, from both operational and clinical point of view.

        "abstract": "Abstract Information visualization is a rapidly evolving field with a growing volume of scientific literature and texts continually published. To keep abreast of the latest developments in the domain, survey papers and state-of-the-art reviews provide valuable tools for managing the large quantity of scientific literature. Recently, a survey of survey papers was published to keep track of the quantity of refereed survey papers in information visualization conferences and journals. However, no such resources exist to inform readers of the large volume of books being published on the subject, leaving the possibility of valuable knowledge being overlooked. We present the first literature survey of information visualization books that addresses this challenge by surveying the large volume of books on the topic of information visualization and visual analytics. This unique survey addresses some special challenges associated with collections of books (as opposed to research papers) including searching, browsing and cost. This paper features a novel two-level classification based on both books and chapter topics examined in each book, enabling the reader to quickly identify to what depth a topic of interest is covered within a particular book. Readers can use this survey to identify the most relevant book for their needs amongst a quickly expanding collection. In indexing the landscape of information visualization books, this survey provides a valuable resource to both experienced researchers and newcomers in the data visualization\u00a0discipline.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Visual data analysis can be envisioned as a collaboration of the user and the computational system with the aim of completing a given task. Pursuing an effective system-user integration, in which the system actively helps the user to reach his/her analysis goal has been focus of visualization research for quite some time. However, this problem is still largely unsolved. As a result, users might be overwhelmed by powerful but complex visual analysis systems which also limits their ability to produce insightful results. In this context, guidance is a promising step towards enabling an effective mixed-initiative collaboration to promote the visual analysis. However, the way how guidance should be put into practice is still to be unravelled. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive literature research and provide an overview of how guidance is tackled by different approaches in visual analysis systems. We distinguish between guidance that is provided by the system to support the user, and guidance that is provided by the user to support the system. By identifying open problems, we highlight promising research directions and point to missing factors that are needed to enable the envisioned human-computer collaboration, and thus, promote a more effective visual data analysis.",

Large volumes of heterogeneous health records require advanced visualization and visual analytics systems to uncover valuable insight buried in complex databases.

We present the state-of-the-art (STAR) of EHR Vis literature and open access healthcare data sources and provide an up-to-date overview on this important topic. We identify trends and challenges in the field, introduce novel literature and data classifications, and incorporate a popular medical terminology standard called the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). We provide a curated list of electronic and population healthcare data sources and open access datasets as a resource for potential researchers, in order to address one of the main challenges in this field. We classify the literature based on multidisciplinary research themes stemming from reoccurring topics.

        "abstract": "The number of electronic health records (EHRs) collected by healthcare providers is growing at an unprecedented pace. Clinicians often compose detailed clinic letters to record as much essential information during consultations as they can. This increases the workload of analyzing these letters, performing individual and collective analysis, and clinical decision making. This paper presents a novel visualization tool, LetterVis, to support the analysis of clinic letters through advanced interactive visual designs and queries. We describe a letter-space that facilities the visual exploration of content and patterns inside a letter. Letters are processed using natural language processing techniques and explored in multiple linked interactive views providing different levels of abstraction. The tool includes customized visual designs and views for visualizing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). We provide a range of filtering and selection options to assist pattern finding and outlier detection. We demonstrate LetterVis with three case studies using anonymized clinic letters, revealing insight that is normally either time\u0002consuming or impossible to observe. Domain expert partners from EHR analysis review the software and are involved in every phase from the initial design to evaluation",
